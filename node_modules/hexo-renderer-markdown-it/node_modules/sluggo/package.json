Add that file to your frontend javascript world.\n\nNow you can call the `sluggo()` function anywhere.\n\nYou do NOT need `generator.js`, which we will use when the next version of Unicode comes out to update this module.\n\n## About P'unk Avenue and Apostrophe\n\n`sluggo` was created at [P'unk Avenue](http://punkave.com) for use in many projects built with Apostrophe, an open-source content management system built on node.js. If you like `sluggo` you should definitely [check out apostrophenow.org](http://apostrophenow.org).\n\n## Support\n\nFeel free to open issues on [github](http://github.com/punkave/sluggo).\n\n<a href=\"http://punkave.com/\"><img src=\"https://raw.github.com/punkave/sluggo/master/logos/logo-box-builtby.png\" /></a>\n\n## Changelog\n\n### CHANGES IN 0.2.0\n\nWhoops, the classic apostrophe slugify method accepted `allow`, not `allowed`. We just released this today, so I've switched to `allow` in `sluggo` as well. However I did bump to 0.2.0 to remain faithful to the semver standard.\n\n### CHANGES IN 0.1.2\n\nConverts to lowercase properly.\n\n### CHANGES IN 0.1.1\n\nPackaged correctly to work in either node or the browser.\n\n### CHANGES IN 0.1.0\n\nInitial release.\n\n\n",
